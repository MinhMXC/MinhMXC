### Hey! Nice to see you

I'm Minh and I'm currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I enjoy learning about anything computer-related, be it building actual products or solving some crazy difficult agorithm questions. I have experience in developing Android apps and Web development. Now, I'm learning about computer graphics in my free time, trying to build my own ray-tracing engine.
